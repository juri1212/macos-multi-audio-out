# Notes:
# - The workflow triggers on tag pushes like `v1.2.3` and via manual dispatch.
# - It builds the `Duophonic` scheme in Release configuration and disables code signing for CI.
# - To fully automate a Homebrew tap update, a separate step is needed to update the tap repo and open a PR (requires a token with push rights to the tap stored as `HOMEBREW_PAT`).
